The zebra is oriented towards the left side of the scene. It is characterized by its distinctive black and white stripes, which are more pronounced on its body than on its legs. The mane and tail of the zebra are black, providing a stark contrast to the white stripes. The zebra appears to be stationary, with no discernible action taking place. There are no texts or other objects in the scene. The relative position of the zebra to the background suggests it is centrally located within the frame. The scene does not contain any other objects, making the zebra the sole focus of the viewer's attention."
